### Match Prediction

**Brady Menendez**

#### Executive summary


#### Rationale
This model, and its ability to identify the most important factors when it comes to deciding the outcome of a match, can be very useful for both game developers and professional players. This can help identify undesired trends that can be fixed with balance changes, or detect what to focus on when it comes to minmaxing resources and coming up with new strategies. The winner prediction part of the model can be used to make better decisions when it comes to betting.

#### Research Question
Identify which features are the most relevant when it comes to predicting the outcome of the match.
Ability to predict the winner of a match based on mid-game live stats, or give a confidence percentage that reflects winning odds.
